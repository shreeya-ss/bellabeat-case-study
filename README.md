### Bellabeat Case Study

## Overview
In order to maximize their marketing approach for the Bellabeat Time wellness watch, Bellabeat wants to know how people utilize smart gadgets.
My task as a data analyst is to examine smart device usage data (especially using Fitbit user activity) in order to identify patterns and suggest tactical measures for Bellabeat's marketing team.  

## Data Source
FitBit Fitness Tracker Dataset from Kaggle.

## Files Included

1. script_bellabeat_case_study.Rmd — Contains the complete RMarkdown case study and the relating analysis code.
2. index.html — Knitted HTML report generated from the RMarkdown file.

## Limitations

- Small sample (30 users)  
- May not be able to reflect **current** device usage habits (data from 2016)
- Not fully representative of Bellabeat’s female-focused target market

## Workflow

* Unique records are chosen after the data has been imported and cleaned.
* Correlations and summary statistics are observed (e.g., steps vs. sleep).
* Numerous visualizations are produced, including weekday patterns, average steps, sleep, and calories.
* Based on insights about user behavior, practical marketing recommendations are made.

## Key Insights

* The majority of users sleep for 6.3 hours and walk 6,538 steps on average each day.
* Longer sleep duration is correlated with higher activity levels.
* Sundays and Mondays are leisure days; users are most active in the middle of the week.
* Step count and distance are closely related to calories burned.
